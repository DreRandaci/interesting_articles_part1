- A different background color.
- A different font family.
- A different font size.
- A different font color.
- A different line height.
- A different padding value.
- Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size (e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)

For exemplary purposes and practice working with basic HTML and CSS.
